The game inched close to extra-time but it was the Ghanaians who lived on tight rope in added time as Aurier raced past Ayew with a lightening pace before whipping in an incisive cross which was parried back into play by Razak Braimah but there was man in orange to connect.
 In extra time it was the Ghanaians who looked like scoring with Atsu controlling a free-kick on his chest with such impudence before advertising a half volley mid-air which whisked just wide.
